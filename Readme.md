Rent vs Buy decision is based on below factors

Unrecoverable cost comparison
For rent
- rent*12 per year
- amount that I have saved as interest which can be invested in SIP with some average yearly return

For owner 
- Loan interest paid throughout tenure of loan
- Cost of equity on down payment
  - depends on stock market average yield expected for next 20 years
  - minus the expected return on real estate in next 20 years
  - both of them adjusted with average inflation before minus operation
- Cost of debt on interest paid 
  - depends on average loan interest rate
- cost of property maintenance
- yearly property tax

Calculation for flat
This should consider the fraction of plot space as owned and apply the real estate market increment on it only
Flat will have a life
At the end of life the furniture and the structure of flat will reduce the value to zero

Finally
We want to check how much it costs for us to rent till alternate end of life of property to be bought and the leftover real estate value from it after 40 years
