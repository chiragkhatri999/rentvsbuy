# Rent vs Buy decision is based on below factors

We will compare the cost of rent vs buying for the duration life of property structure to be bought.

## For rent
- Rent paid per year
- Rent paid per month which could have been a SIP

## For owner
- Cost of equity on down payment
  - Compare with down payment paid as lump sum investment in equity.
- Cost of debt on EMI paid 
  - monthly EMI could have been monthly SIP investment.
- cost of property maintenance (coming soon...)
- yearly property tax (coming soon...)
- land value appreciation over time.

## Considerations
- Interest/Appreciation percentage are adjusted for inflation before applying.
- Intermediate values are valid only for comparison and not as absolute values. Due to it being inflation adjusted.
- At the end of life the furniture and the structure of flat will reduce the value to zero.
- For flat - the fraction of plot space as owned and apply the real estate market increment on it only.

## Roadmap
- expose REST API
- expose UI to input the values
- Auto-calculate some of the input parameters intelligently
